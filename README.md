## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between the **physical difficulty** of sports and their **global popularity**. Using a dataset of 60 sports ranked by athletic skills (Endurance, Strength, Speed, Agility, etc.), I enriched the data with a custom "Popularity Index" to answer a key question: **Do harder sports attract more fans?**

This repository contains the full data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and an interactive dashboard built with **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Enrichment:** Merged physical attribute data with a custom Popularity Index dictionary.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Correlation Heatmaps to visualize skill relationships.
    * Scatter plots analyzing Strength vs. Power.
    * Comparative analysis (e.g., Football vs. Basketball).
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A web app allowing users to:
    * Filter sports by skill levels.
    * Visualize correlations dynamically.
    * Compare any two sports head-to-head.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `app.py`: The main source code for the Streamlit dashboard.
* `which_sport_is_best.csv`: The original raw dataset.
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.

## 💡 Key Insights
Based on the data analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:
1.  **Agility > Strength:** There is a stronger positive correlation between **Agility/Speed** and Popularity compared to pure Strength.
2.  **Entertainment Value:** High-difficulty sports are not necessarily the most popular; audiences prefer fast-paced action.
3.  **Skill Clustering:** Sports cluster logically by attributes (e.g., Combat sports share high Durability and Nerve scores).

## 📚 Data Source
The original dataset, *"Which Sport is Best?"*, was sourced from Kaggle. It evaluates sports across 10 distinct physical and mental skills.
